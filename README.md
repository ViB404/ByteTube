## üîç Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
The Rust-powered backend is the heart of ByteTube, handling:

- **Video Chunking**: Implements HTTP `Range` headers to optimize bandwidth and startup time
- **WebSocket Management**: Robust connection lifecycle with ping/pong health checks
- **Actor System**: Scalable message broadcasting for real-time chat
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**: Configured CORS for secure cross-domain requests
- **Transport Layer Security**: TLS implementation for secure communications

### Frontend Design
The Next.js frontend provides:

- **Responsive Video Player**: Adapts to different screen sizes with minimal buffering
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Low-latency messaging with user presence indicators
- **Dark Theme UI**: Easy on the eyes for extended viewing sessions
- **Optimized Asset Loading**: Efficient resource management for faster page loads

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable)
- Next.JS 13+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ViB404/bytetube.git

# Navigate to backend directory
cd bytetube/bytetube_backend

# Run the backend server
cargo run
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd bytetube/bytetube_frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## üåê Deployment

### Backend Deployment
```bash
# Build optimized release
cd bytetube_backend
cargo build --release

# Run with production settings
./target/release/bytetube_backend
```

### Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build production bundle
cd bytetube_frontend
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

For cloud deployment:
- Backend: Railway.app or Render
- Frontend: Vercel
- Remember to update environment variables for production URLs

## üß™ Architecture Insights

ByteTube demonstrates several key concepts in modern media streaming:

1. **Why Chunked Delivery Matters**: 
   - Reduces initial load time
   - Enables seeking without downloading entire video
   - Conserves bandwidth for both server and client

2. **WebSocket Implementation Details**:
   - Connection establishment and maintenance
   - Message serialization and broadcasting
   - Session management and cleanup

3. **Cross-Origin Considerations**:
   - Secure header configuration
   - Preflight request handling
   - Credential management

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas that would benefit from community input:

- Performance optimizations for video processing
- Multi-room chat functionality
- Enhanced UI components
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

Please follow the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow.
